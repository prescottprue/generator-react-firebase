## Requirements

* node `^8`
* npm `^3.0.0`

## Getting Started

1. Install app and functions dependencies: `npm i && npm i --prefix functions` or `yarn install && yarn install --cwd functions`
1. Create `src/config.js` file that looks like so if it does not already exist:
    ```js
    const firebase = {
      // Config from Firebase console
    }

    // Overrides for for react-redux-firebase/redux-firestore config
    export const reduxFirebase = {}<% if (includeAnalytics) { %>

    export const analyticsTrackingId = '<- Google Analytics Tracking ID ->'<% } %><% if (firebasePublicVapidKey) { %>

    export const publicVapidKey = '<- publicVapidKey from Firebase console ->'<% } %><% if (sentryDsn) { %>

    export const sentryDsn = '<- DSN From Sentry.io ->'<% } %>

    export default {
      env,
      firebase,
      reduxFirebase<% if (sentryDsn) { %>,
      sentryDsn<% } %><% if (firebasePublicVapidKey) { %>,
      publicVapidKey<% } %><% if (includeAnalytics) { %>,
      analyticsTrackingId<% } %>
    }
    ```
1. Start Development server: `npm start`

While developing, you will probably rely mostly on `npm start`; however, there are additional scripts at your disposal:

|`npm run <script>`    |Description|
|-------------------|-----------|
|`start`            |Serves your app at `localhost:3000` and displays [Webpack Dashboard](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/webpack-dashboard)|
|`start:simple`     |Serves your app at `localhost:3000` without [Webpack Dashboard](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/webpack-dashboard)|
|`build`            |Builds the application to ./dist|<% if (includeTests) { %>
|`test`             |Runs unit tests with Karma. See [testing](#testing)|
|`test:watch`       |Runs `test` in watch mode to re-run tests when changed|<% } %>
|`lint`             |[Lints](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8503559/what-is-linting) the project for potential errors|
|`lint:fix`         |Lints the project and [fixes all correctable errors](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface.html#fix)|

[Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) is used to enable `prepush` hook capability. The `prepush` script currently runs `eslint`, which will keep you from pushing if there is any lint within your code. If you would like to disable this, remove the `prepush` script from the `package.json`.

## Config Files

There are multiple configuration files:

* Project Path Configuration - `project.config.js`
* Firebase Project Configuration (including settings for how `src/config.js` is built on CI) - `.firebaserc`
* Project Configuration used within source (can change based on environment variables on CI) - `src/config.js`
* Cloud Functions Local Configuration - `functions/.runtimeconfig.json`

More details in the [Application Structure Section](#application-structure)

## Application Structure

The application structure presented in this boilerplate is **fractal**, where functionality is grouped primarily by feature rather than file type. Please note, however, that this structure is only meant to serve as a guide, it is by no means prescriptive. That said, it aims to represent generally accepted guidelines and patterns for building scalable applications. If you wish to read more about this pattern, please check out this [awesome writeup](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit/wiki/Fractal-Project-Structure) by [Justin Greenberg](https://github.com/justingreenberg).

### Routing
We use `react-router` [route definitions](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/v3/docs/API.md#plainroute) (`<route>/index.js`) to define units of logic within our application. See the [application structure](#application-structure) section for more information.

<% if (includeTests) { %>## Testing
To add a unit test, create a `.spec.js` file anywhere inside of `./tests`. Karma and webpack will automatically find these files, and Mocha and Chai will be available within your test without the need to import them.

<% } %>## Production

Build code before deployment by running `npm run build`. There are multiple options below for types of deployment, if you are unsure, checkout the Firebase section.

### Deployment
<% if (deployTo === 'firebase') { %>
1. Install Firebase Command Line Tool: `npm i -g firebase-tools`

#### CI Deploy (recommended)
<% if (includeCI && ciProvider == 'travis') { %>**Note**: Config for this is located within `travis.yml`
`firebase-ci` has been added to simplify the CI deployment process. All that is required is providing authentication with Firebase:

1. Login: `firebase login:ci` to generate an authentication token (will be used to give Travis-CI rights to deploy on your behalf)
1. Set `FIREBASE_TOKEN` environment variable within Travis-CI environment
1. Run a build on Travis-CI

If you would like to deploy to different Firebase instances for different branches (i.e. `prod`), change `ci` settings within `.firebaserc`.

For more options on CI settings checkout the [firebase-ci docs](https://github.com/prescottprue/firebase-ci)<% } %><% if (!includeCI) { %>1. Login: `firebase login:ci` to generate an authentication token (will be used to give your CI environment rights to deploy on your behalf)
1. Set `FIREBASE_TOKEN` environment variable within your CI environment
1. Create a build script that does the following:
  1. Create a config file by calling `npm run create-config`
  1. Install firebase tools by calling `npm i -g firebase-tools`
  1. Call firebase deploy: `firebase deploy --project ${projectName}` (if you are using functions, make sure to first install dependencies using  `npm i --prefix functions`)<% } %>

#### Manual deploy

1. Run `firebase:login`
1. Initialize project with `firebase init` then answer:
  * What file should be used for Database Rules?  -> `database.rules.json`
  * What do you want to use as your public directory? -> `build`
  * Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? -> `Yes`
  * What Firebase project do you want to associate as default?  -> **your Firebase project name**
1. Build Project: `npm run build`
1. Confirm Firebase config by running locally: `firebase serve`
1. Deploy to Firebase (everything including Hosting and Functions): `firebase deploy`
**NOTE:** You can use `firebase serve` to test how your application will work when deployed to Firebase, but make sure you run `npm run build` first.<% } %><% if (deployTo === 's3') { %>
Selecting AWS S3 from the deploy options when running the generator adds deploy configs in `.travis.yml`.

1. Get your AWS Key and Secret from the AWS Console Credentials page
2. Set the following environment vars within the Travis-CI repo settings page:
  * AWS_KEY - Your AWS key
  * AWS_SECRET - Your AWS secret
  * BUCKET - Your S3 Bucket<% } %><% if (deployTo === 'heroku') { %>
Selecting [Heroku](http://heroku.com) from the deploy options when running the generator adds a `Procfile` as well as deploy configs in `.travis.yml` for out of the box deployment.

To deploy to [Heroku](http://heroku.com) through [Travis-CI](http://travis-ci.org):
1. Enable Repo on Travis-CI Account
2. Get API Key from Heroku Dashboard
3. Create a new App (this name will be used in travis env var)
4. Set the following environment vars within the Travis-CI repo settings page:
  * HEROKU_KEY - Your Heroku API key
  * APP - Your Heroku App name<% } %>

## FAQ

1. Why node `8` instead of a newer version?

  [Cloud Functions runtime runs on `8`](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/writing/#the_cloud_functions_runtime), which is why that is what is used for the travis build version.

1. Why `enhancers` over `containers`? - For many reasons, here are just a few:
    * separates concerns to have action/business logic move to enhancers (easier for future modularization + optimization)
    * components remain "dumb" by only receiving props which makes them more portable
    * smaller files which are easier to parse
    * functional components can be helpful (along with other tools) when attempting to optimize things
