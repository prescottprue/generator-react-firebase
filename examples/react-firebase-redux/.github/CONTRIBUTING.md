# Contributing Guidelines

Some basic conventions for contributing to this project.

## General

Please make sure that there aren't existing pull requests attempting to address the issue mentioned. Likewise, please check for issues related to update, as someone else may be working on the issue in a branch or fork.

- Non-trivial changes should be discussed in an issue first
- Develop in a topic branch, not master
- Squash your commits

## Linting

Please check your code using `npm run lint` before submitting your pull requests, as the CI build will fail if `eslint` fails.
