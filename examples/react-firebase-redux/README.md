## Requirements
* node `^5.0.0`
* yarn `^0.23.0` or npm `^3.0.0`

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies: `yarn` or `npm install`

2. Start Development server: `yarn start` or `npm start`

While developing, you will probably rely mostly on `npm start`; however, there are additional scripts at your disposal:

|`npm run <script>`|Description|
|------------------|-----------|
|`start`|Serves your app at `localhost:3000`. HMR will be enabled in development.|
|`compile`|Compiles the application to disk (`~/dist` by default).|
|`dev`|Same as `npm start`, but enables nodemon for the server as well.|
|`test`|Runs unit tests with Karma and generates a coverage report.|
|`test:dev`|Runs Karma and watches for changes to re-run tests; does not generate coverage reports.|
|`build`|Runs linter, tests, and then, on success, compiles your application to disk.|
|`build:dev`|Same as `build` but overrides `NODE_ENV` to "development".|
|`build:prod`|Same as `build` but overrides `NODE_ENV` to "production".|
|`lint`|Lint all `.js` files.|
|`lint:fix`|Lint and fix all `.js` files. [Read more on this](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface.html#fix).|

## Application Structure

The application structure presented in this boilerplate is **fractal**, where functionality is grouped primarily by feature rather than file type. Please note, however, that this structure is only meant to serve as a guide, it is by no means prescriptive. That said, it aims to represent generally accepted guidelines and patterns for building scalable applications. If you wish to read more about this pattern, please check out this [awesome writeup](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit/wiki/Fractal-Project-Structure) by [Justin Greenberg](https://github.com/justingreenberg).

## Development

### Routing
We use `react-router` [route definitions](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/v3/docs/API.md#plainroute) (`<route>/index.js`) to define units of logic within our application. See the [application structure](#application-structure) section for more information.

## Testing
To add a unit test, simply create a `.spec.js` file anywhere in `~/tests`. Karma will pick up on these files automatically, and Mocha and Chai will be available within your test without the need to import them. Coverage reports will be compiled to `~/coverage` by default. If you wish to change what reporters are used and where reports are compiled, you can do so by modifying `coverage_reporters` in `~/config/index.js`.

## Configuration

Default project configuration can be found in `~/config/index.js`. Here you'll be able to redefine your `src` and `dist` directories, adjust compilation settings, tweak your vendor dependencies, and more. For the most part, you should be able to make changes in here **without ever having to touch the actual webpack build configuration**.

If you need environment-specific overrides (useful for dynamically setting API endpoints, for example), you can edit `~/config/environments.js` and define overrides on a per-NODE_ENV basis. There are examples for both `development` and `production`, so use those as guidelines

## Production

Build code before deployment by running `npm run build:prod`. There are multiple options below for types of deployment, if you are unsure, checkout the Firebase section.

### Deployment

1. Login to [Firebase](firebase.google.com) (or Signup if you don't have an account) and create a new project
2. Install cli: `npm i -g firebase-tools`
3. Login: `firebase login`
4. Initialize project with `firebase init` then answer:
  * What file should be used for Database Rules?  -> `database.rules.json`
  * What do you want to use as your public directory? -> `build`
  * Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? -> `Yes`
  * What Firebase project do you want to associate as default?  -> **your Firebase project name**
5. Build Project: `npm run build`
6. Confirm Firebase config by running locally: `firebase serve`
7. Deploy to firebase: `firebase deploy`
**NOTE:** You can use `firebase serve` to test how your application will work when deployed to Firebase, but make sure you run `npm run build` or `npm run build:prod` first.
